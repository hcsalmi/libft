# libft

A Hive Helsinki school project. <br />
<br />
The Goal:<br />
The aim is to recode standard C library functions to create a personal library that can be used in later projects. <br />
As you have to recode the functions as close to the original as possible, this project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. It allows you to grasp the basics of C in a very fundamental manner. <br />
<br />
The Contents:<br />
This library includes both the functions from the old curriculum libft project, as well as the new curriculum ones. In addition to this, I have expanded the library so that includes other usuful functions. <br />
The library also includes the projects get_next_line (old curriculum version) and ft_printf (old curriculum version).<br />
